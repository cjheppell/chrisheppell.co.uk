This is the first blog post on my new website.

The intention is for this to be a place I can share things I learn,
things I'm working on, or anything else that I can think of.

Having not done a _huge_ amount of frontend work, this website also gives me an opportunity 
to experiment and learn how to get better at designing pages. So expect the styling to change
an awful lot.

### Technical details

It also felt like a good opportunity to try out [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
to generate this static website. I'd previously tried to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) 
and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but found them both pretty difficult to get started with.

Gatsby, on the other hand, is just standard React (with a bit of 
GraphQL on the side). Since I'm familiar with ReactJS from my job,
it was much easier to get started.

I'm also using [React Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) for
the various React components on this site.

### Hosting

I'm hosting this website on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), fronted by a custom domain provided by [TSOHost](https://www.tsohost.com/).

### Wrap-up

That's all for now. This is the first time I've actually followed through with getting a 
personal website actually up and running. I've written the code a bunch of times in
the past in private GitHub repos, but never got around to getting them hosted.

Hopefully I'll keep the momentum going!
